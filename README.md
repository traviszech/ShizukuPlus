# Shizuku+

An enhanced version of [Shizuku](https://github.com/RikkaApps/Shizuku) with quality-of-life improvements, backported optimizations, and exclusive Plus APIs.

Shizuku lets normal apps use system-level APIs directly via a privileged process started with adb or root. Shizuku+ keeps full compatibility while adding features for power users and developers.

## ✨ Shizuku+ Core Features

*   **Universal Privilege Provider**: Combines **Root**, **ADB Shell**, and **Dhizuku (Device Owner)** into a single unified interface.
*   **OneUI 8+ Theming Fix**: Provides the necessary **Overlay Manager Plus** bridge to allow engines like Hex Installer or Substratum to function on Android 16/17 and OneUI 8+.
*   **Dhizuku Mode**: Share the system `DevicePolicyManager` binder with any app that has Shizuku permissions.
*   **Customizable Gestures**: Configure swipe left, swipe right, and long-press actions for any app in the management list.
*   **Bulk Management**: Multi-select apps to grant/revoke permissions or hide them in one tap.
*   **Activity Log**: Audit trail of which apps are using Shizuku and what actions they are performing.
*   **Service Doctor**: In-app diagnostic tool to troubleshoot and fix service startup issues.
*   **Quick Settings Tile**: Conveniently view and toggle the service status from your notification panel.

## 🚀 Plus API Features

Shizuku+ provides exclusive system interfaces for advanced automation and tools:

*   **AVF (Virtual Machine) Manager**: Manage isolated Linux/Microdroid VMs with VirtIO-GPU acceleration.
*   **Privileged Storage Proxy**: Authenticated access to restricted paths like `/data/data/` for verified tools.
*   **Intelligence Bridge (AI Core Plus)**: Privileged NPU scheduling and screen context intelligence.
*   **Window Manager Plus**: Force free-form resizing, manage the system "Bubble Bar," and resilient overlays.
*   **System Theming Bridge (Overlay Manager Plus)**: Expose privileged overlay management for rootless theming (like Hex Installer).
*   **Network & DNS Governor**: Manage Private DNS and iptables routing for rootless ad-blockers and firewalls.
*   **Deep Process Control (Activity Manager Plus)**: Allow advanced process managers to deeply kill apps and set standby buckets.
*   **Continuity Bridge**: Secure state and task handoff between ShizukuPlus-enabled devices.

## 🛠️ Backporting & Optimizations

Shizuku+ makes regular Shizuku apps faster and more compatible without any code changes:

*   **Transparent Shell Interceptor**: Intercepts common `pm`, `am`, and `settings` commands and routes them through high-performance native APIs.
*   **Legacy Compatibility Bridges**:
    *   **Local ADB Proxy**: Emulates an ADB server on port 15555, allowing legacy apps to use Shizuku privileges without keeping the system Wireless ADB enabled.
    *   **Fake SU Wrapper**: A Shizuku-backed `su` binary drop-in replacement for non-rooted apps that support custom root paths.
*   **`plus` CLI Helper**: Adds a privileged command-line utility to the `rish` environment for advanced terminal use.
*   **Dynamic App Database**: Fetches the latest app descriptions and enhancement suggestions from GitHub to keep the UI up-to-date.

## ⚙️ Modular Control

Everything in Shizuku+ is optional. Use the **Plus Features** category in Settings to toggle:
*   Transparent Shell Interception
*   Individual Plus APIs (AVF, Storage, Intelligence, etc.)
*   Home screen card visibility
*   Activity Logging
